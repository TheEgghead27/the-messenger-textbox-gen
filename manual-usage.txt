Use some image manipulation software to add a profile photo or image of yourself 
to the text box and save that file as (namehere)template.png or something like that.

When you want to add text to the image, make sure the font is installed on your 
system and line up the top and bottom of your first letter in the sentence with 
the 2 white pixels in the template. 
This will allow you to figure out the correct spacing and font size.

There is a second image template file included that is less accurate to the ARG but higher resolution, called template-smoothe.png.
Thanks to Steph from The Messenger Discord server for making the higher res version.

Good luck!
